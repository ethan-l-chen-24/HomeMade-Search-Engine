### common

This is a common directory to each of the major TSE modules. It contains `pagedir.h` and `pagedir.c` at the moment, although I am sure I will be adding onto this module as we continue the Tiny Search Engine.

### Compilation

To compile, just call `make`. This will compile the files and create a .a file to store the object files.
