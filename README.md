To build, run `make`.

To clean up, run `make clean`.

For this project, I attribute a few sources
    - the course notes, especially for creating and grabbing from archive files
    - StackOverflow and TutorialsPoint for figuring out how to build a string (which, by 
        the way, is way too difficult in C)
    - the Makefiles from previous labs, which as usual, I copied a fair amount from
    - the Pseudocode, which I not only adapted, but modified slightly for my IMPLEMENTATION.md file
    - finally, the support of my friends and family. Thank you mom and dad, even though
        I never even mentioned this project to you, for your unconditional love and
        psychopathic help throughout it all
