To build, run `make`.

To clean up, run `make clean`.

### Lab 4

For this project, I attribute a few sources
    - the course notes, especially for creating and grabbing from archive files
    - StackOverflow and TutorialsPoint for figuring out how to build a string (which, by 
        the way, is way too difficult in C)
    - the Makefiles from previous labs, which as usual, I copied a fair amount from
    - the Pseudocode, which I not only adapted, but modified slightly for my IMPLEMENTATION.md file
    - Huge HUGE shoutout to Kysen for helping me debug an error in my code
    - finally, the support of my friends and family. Thank you mom and dad, even though
        I never even mentioned this project to you, for your unconditional love and
        psychopathic help throughout it all

It is worth noting that
    - I used all camelCase for this code. I know that the other modules that were given are all in snake   
        case, but I can't stand the look of it, so sorry for that inconsistency!
    - I wasn't sure where to put the directory that webpage files are inserted into, so I placed it in
        common, for I assumed that _indexer_ and _query_ are also going to draw from those files, so
        I thought it would make sense for it to be placed in the common section
    - I made all of my * for pointers next to the data type, I just prefer char* string in comparison to something like char *string
